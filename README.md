# 4100901-final-project
This repository contains the example for the final project of the course computation structures. Please go to the [C4Model](Doc/C4Model.md) diagrams for more details on the functionality of the system.

## Hardware prerequisites
* The example is a digital lock system featuring an STM32L4 for controling the system, an ESP8266 for interfacing with the internet, a keypad for getting the sequences, and an OLED display for GUI. See more details in the [C4Model](Doc/C4Model.md)
* The following is the pinout of the STM32:

## Firmware prerequisites
* The ESP8266 runs the esp-link [v2.2.3](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link/releases/tag/v2.2.3) firmware. Please follow the [serial flashing guide](https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link/blob/master/FLASHING.md#initial-serial-flashing).
* The STM32 runs the firmware compiled from this repository using STM32CubeIDE.

## Building and Flashing
* Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
* Compile using the current project settings.
* Use an ST-LINK to flash the firmware into the STM32.

## Functionality

The Keypad:
This input device, commonly known as a numeric keypad, plays a critical role in the digital lock system by providing an intuitive interface for users. It allows the input of specific sequences of numbers or characters, acting as the key that authenticates and unlocks the lock. User interaction with this component becomes fundamental, as its precision and effectiveness are crucial for ensuring the security of the system.

The Debug Console:
The debug console not only provides a superficial view but also offers a detailed immersion into the internal functioning of the system. This advanced interface becomes an essential tool for developers and technicians, presenting debug messages, comprehensive logs, and the detection of potential errors. It facilitates the efficient identification and resolution of issues, enabling faster development and continuous improvement of the system.

The Internet Interface:
The capability of the digital lock system to connect through a web interface with the Internet significantly enhances its functionality. This interface enables bidirectional data transmission over the network, allowing precise time synchronization, remote firmware updates, and the reception of important notifications. The web interface becomes the vital link between the system and the vast online world.

The System Sends Data to the Cloud:
The configuration allowing the system to send data to the cloud at regular intervals, every 24 hours in this case, reveals a proactive strategy for remote management and efficient monitoring. This process is achieved through an alarm generated by the integrated Real-Time Clock (RTC) in the system. The data sent to the cloud may include detailed information about the operational status of the system, event logs, usage patterns, and other valuable insights. This not only facilitates continuous tracking but also supports informed decision-making for system maintenance and continuous improvement. In this context, the cloud becomes a centralized repository for the intelligence of the system, facilitating effective remote management.
